Showcase is the perfect tool for demoing your work at tech events and conferences. Select the videos you'd like to show off, set a passcode, and you're ready to goâ€”your playlist will loop until you're finished. Bonus: If you plug your phone or tablet in, don't sweat about leaving it unattended; now you can add a siren that'll alert you if some felon tries to run off with your device.
